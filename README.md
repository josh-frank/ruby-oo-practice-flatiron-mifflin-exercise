# The Office

In this project, you will get the chance to practice object relationships in Ruby, with a particular emphasis on the `has_many/belongs_to` relationship. Make sure you read the entire README and map out your domain models before writing any code!

## Introduction
Welcome to your first day at the Flatiron Mifflin Paper Company. As the Assistant to the Regional Manager, your job is to implement the new Office Management System for both the employees and their managers. Since Michael (your boss) has personally tasked you with this job, you can't disappoint.

## Setup (Code)
Your goal is to build out all of the methods listed in the deliverables. Do your best to follow Ruby best practices. For example, use higher-level array methods such as `map`, `select`, and `find` when appropriate in place of each

We've provided you with a console that you can use to test your code. To enter a console session, run `ruby run.rb` from the command line. You'll be able to test out the methods that you write here. Take a look at that file to see how you can pre-define variables and create object instances, rather than manually doing it in every single console session.

_Keep in mind that in order to properly build out the relationships between the three models, one of these classes will be instantiated with objects of others. This will not be mentioned in the description below, you need to deduce it on your own. Consider where and how this dependency needs to be implemented._

There are **no** tests! You will need to test your code on your own!

## Domain Modeling
First step to this problem is to consider your domain. At Flatiron Mifflin, an `Employee` will only have one `Manager` but a manager can have many `Employee`s. Each `Department` can have many `Employee`s and each `Employee` only has one `Department`.

Here are some questions to consider:
- What are your models?
- What does your domain look like?
- What are the relationships between your models?

## Deliverables

**`Manager`**
  * Manager is initialized with a name, department and age. All of these attributes can change.
  * `Manager#name`
    * returns a `String` that is the manager's name
  * `Manager#department`
    * returns a `String` that is the department that the manager oversees
  * `Manager#age`
    * returns a `Fixnum` that is the age of the manager
  * `Manager#employees`
    * returns an `Array` of all the employees that the manager oversees
  * `Manager#roles`
    * returns an `Array` of all the roles that the manager oversees
  * `Manager.all`
    * returns an `Array` of all the managers
  * `Manager.all_departments`
    * returns an `Array` of all the department names that every manager oversees without repetitions
  * `Manager.average_age`
    * returns a `Float` that is the average age of all the managers

**`Employee`**
  * Employee is initialized with a name and salary. All of these attributes can change.
  * `Employee#name`
    * returns a `String` that is the employee's name
  * `Employee#salary`
    * returns a `Fixnum` that is the employee's salary
  * `Employee#manager_name`
    * returns a `String` that is the name of their manager
  * `Employee.all`
    * returns an `Array` of all the employees
  * `Employee.paid_over`
    * takes a `Fixnum` argument and returns an `Array` of all the employees whose salaries are over that amount
  * `Employee.find_by_department`
    * takes a `String` argument that is the name of a department and returns the first employee whose manager is working in that department
  * `Employee#tax_bracket`
    * returns an `Array` of all the employees whose salaries are within $1000 (Â± 1000) of the employee who invoked the method
  * `Employee.search_by_role`
    * takes a `String` argument that is the name of a role and returns all the employees who work at that role
  * `Employee#get_promoted`
    * takes an argument of an instance of a Role, updates Employee's role and increases Employee's salary.

**`Role`**
  * Role is initialized with a name, which won't ever change.
  * `Role#name`
    * returns a `String` that is the role's name
  * `Role#employees`
    * returns an array of all the Employees who work at that role
  * `Role#managers`
    * returns a unique array of all the Manager instances who oversee Employees at that role 
  * `Role.all`
    * returns an `Array` of all the roles
  * `Role#add_employee`
    * takes a `String` argument of an employee's name, a `Fixnum` argument of the employee's salary and an instance of a Manager class and creates a new employee who work at this role
